# Topics-In-Algorithms
This contains several topics in algorithms for my minor project.

The main description of the project is--

Objective of Work:

This project is mainly aimed to focus on the topics including algorithms        Data-Structures,their comparison and optimisation.   

This will not only improve skills which are needed in the industry,but also improve critical thinking skills.

In this project we will dive deep into various algorithms and try to find how different algorithms work under different inputs.





Motivation

   Algorithm and Data Structures are the most durable part of computer   science .I have chosen minor project in this field because I feel that this is the area in which expertise is required so that we can become proficient in other advanced topics like AI/ML etc.











Functional Partitioning of the Project

The project is divided into various parts.    

Part I

This consists of comparison of various Divide and Conquer algorithms and their comparison.We will analyse Segment Tree ,Bit tree and also topics such as square root decomposition.
In different scenarios and sizes of input data which Data Structure holds good.
In the end we will analyse persistent data structures, how they are useful and their comparison with normal non-persistent data Structures.
Finally we would release comparisons between them.

Part II

This part consists of study and development of Graphical Algorithms.
We will try to explore different graphical algorithms and try to find efficient computational algorithms for the same.
We will analyse the following topics
->Graph Traversals
->Connected components,bridges,articulation points.
->Single Source shortest paths
->Flows and Related problems
->Matching and Related problems
->2 SAT and Heavy Light Decomposition

Part III

This part consists of Optimization of Time Complexity of NP hard problems by using approximation analysis.
This part will contain some new problems and also problems which we have solved in above 2 parts.
